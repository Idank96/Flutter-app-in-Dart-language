This is one of my projects - an app designed for Android, iPhone, and Web platforms. 

During the course of this project, I took the initiative to learn the Dart programming language and gain proficiency in utilizing Flutter, a cross-platform UI software development kit developed by Google.

The primary code functions can be found in the following files:

lib/pages/form_screen.dart
lib/functions/myPdf.dart"
