This is one of my projects - an app for Android, Iphone and Web. <br/>
For the purpose of the project I learned Dart language and learned to use Flutter. <br/>
Flutter is a cross platform UI software development kit created by Google.

* The main code functions are in:
1. lib/pages/form_screen.dart
2. lib/functions/myPdf.dart
